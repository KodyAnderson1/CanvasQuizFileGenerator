2. Inappropriately assigns a signed variable to an unsigned variable
3. Improper use of this code features allows the attacker to perform traversal
4. Approximate random numbers statistically
5. Based on crytopgraphic primitives and mathematical problems producing answers hard to predict
6. Multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock

Answers:
Buffer Overflow : Exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer.
Integer Promotion Error : Inappropriately assigns a signed variable to an unsigned variable
Directory Restriction : Improper use of this code features allows the attacker to perform traversal
Statistical Psuedo Random Number Generators : Approximate random numbers statistically
Cryptographic Psuedo Random Number Generators : Based on crytopgraphic primitives and mathematical problems producing answers hard to predict
Deadlock : Multiple threads are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock
Null Pointers : Uninitialized objects are incorrctly accessed
Missing Releae of Memory : Application does not sufficiently track, and release allocated memory after it has been used
--------------------------------

Match the following deadlock causes and solutions.
Answer Bank:
1. Only one process can access a particular resource at a time
2. Some processes must be 1) holding some resources and 2) waiting on other resources at the same time. The other resources are being held by other processes, with mutual exclusion.
3. The held resources can only be released voluntarily by the holding process
4. Processes in deadlock are waiting in a circular fashion such that each process locks one or more resources which the others need to continue
5. Directly prevent circular waits. Indirectly prevent mutual exclusion, no pre-emption, or hold and wait
6. Track resource usage, predict deadlock situations, and re-allocate processes and resources to avoid a deadlock
7. Simulates the allocation of the predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources and tests for safety towards allocating resources.
8. Terminates (kills) one or more processes until the deadlock is removed

Answers:
Mutual Exclusion : Only one process can access a particular resource at a time
Hold and Wait : Some processes must be 1) holding some resources and 2) waiting on other resources at the same time. The other resources are being held by other processes, with mutual exclusion.
No Pre-emption : The held resources can only be released voluntarily by the holding process
Circular Wait : Processes in deadlock are waiting in a circular fashion such that each process locks one or more resources which the others need to continue
Deadlock Prevention : Directly prevent circular waits. Indirectly prevent mutual exclusion, no pre-emption, or hold and wait
Deadlock Avoidance : Track resource usage, predict deadlock situations, and re-allocate processes and resources to avoid a deadlock
